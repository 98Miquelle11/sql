### Database
Simply put, is a collection of information. Less simply, it's a structured collection of data (information), typically organized as a set of tables linked by relationships. 

**Examples**: a telephone directory, a library catalog, or a portal's user database.

### Table
Container for data. A collection of related information, usually presented as an arrangement of horizontal rows and vertical columns. A single database can contain many tables, and in such cases, logical connections (relations) exist between them.

**A record** is a single row in a table, i.e., a set of fields appearing in it. For example, a set of characteristics for a given student (user).

The record **does not have to** contain ALL features of the object. It can be, for example, just a name and surname.

**A field** is a part of a table that stores individual data, e.g. the name of a specific person in the table.
