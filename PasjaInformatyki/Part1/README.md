## Database
Simply put, database is a collection of information. Less simply, it's a structured collection of data (information), typically organized as a set of tables linked by relationships. 

**Examples**: a telephone directory, a library catalog, or a portal's user database.

## Table
Table is a container for data. A collection of related information, usually presented as an arrangement of horizontal rows and vertical columns. A single database can contain many tables, and in such cases, logical connections (relations) exist between them.

### Record
Single row in a table, e.g., a set of fields appearing in it. For example, a set of characteristics for a given student (user).

The record **does not have to** contain ALL features of the object. It can be, for example, just a name and surname.

### Field
Part of a table that stores individual data, e.g. the name of a specific person in the table.

### Primary key
One or more fields whose value uniquely identifies each record in a table. This characteristic of a key is called uniqueness.

**Example**: book nr 4 is a copy of "Pan Tadeusz".
